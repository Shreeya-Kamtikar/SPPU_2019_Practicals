## Problem Statements:
### Statement 1:
Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location. Perform following tasks: 1. Pre-process the dataset. 2. Identify outliers. 3. Check the correlation. 4. Implement linear regression and random forest regression models. 5. Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

### Statement 2:
Classify the email using the binary classification method. Email Spam detection has two states: a) Normal State – Not Spam, b) Abnormal State – Spam. Use K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine for classification. Analyze their performance.

### Statement 3:
Implement Gradient Descent Algorithm to find the local minima of a function.

### Statement 4:
Implement K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on diabetes.csv dataset. Compute confusion matrix, accuracy, error rate, precision and recall on the given dataset.

### Statement 5:
Implement K-Means clustering/ hierarchical clustering on sales_data_sampe.csv dataset. Determine the number of clusters using the elbow method.
