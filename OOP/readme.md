# This folder contains all programs for Object Oriented Programming course of SPPU 2019 Pattern SE SEM 1 Computer Engineering

## Problem Statements:
### Statement 1:
Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the following operations: 1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i). 2. Overloaded operator+ to add two complex numbers. 3. Overloaded operator* to multiply two complex numbers. 4. Overloaded &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; to print and read Complex Numbers

### Statement 2:
Develop a program in C++ to create a database of a student's information system containing the following information: Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact address, Telephone number, Driving license no. and other. Construct the database with suitable member functions. Make use of constructor, default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, static member functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete as well as exception handling.

### Statement 3:
Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audio cassette versions. Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of publications. From this class derive two classes: book which adds a page count (type int) and tape which adds a playing time in minutes (type float). Write a program that instantiates the book and tape class, allows users to enter data and displays the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with zero values.

### Statement 4:
Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file and opens it again as an input file and reads the information from the file.

### Statement 5:
Write a function template for selection sort that inputs, sorts and outputs an integer array and a float array.

### Statement 6:
Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching user defined records such as personal records (Name, DOB, Telephone number etc.) using a vector container.

### Statement 7:
Write a program in C++ to use map associative containers. The keys will be the names of states and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the user is prompted to type the name of a state. The program then looks in the map, using the state name as an index and returns the population of the state.
