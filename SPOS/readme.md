# This folder contains all programs for Systems Programming and Operating Systems course of SPPU 2019 Pattern TE SEM 1 Computer Engineering

## Problem Statements:
### Statement 1:
Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a two-pass assembler for a pseudo machine in Java/C++ using object oriented features. Implementation should consist of a few instructions from each category and few assembler directives.

### Statement 2:
Implement Pass-II of two pass assembler for pseudo-machine in Java/C++ using object oriented features. The output of assignment-1 (intermediate file and symbol table) should be input for this assignment.

### Statement 3:
Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-I of a two pass macro processor using OOP features in Java/C++. The output of Pass-I (MNT, MDT, ALA & Intermediate code file without any macro definitions) should be input for Pass-II.

### Statement 4:
Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-II of a two pass macro processor using OOP features in Java/C++. The output of Pass-I (MNT, MDT, ALA & Intermediate code file without any macro definitions) should be input for Pass-II.

### Statement 5:
Write a program to simulate CPU Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS, SJF (Preemptive), Priority (Non-Preemptive) and Round Robin (Preemptive).

### Statement 6:
Write a program to simulate Memory placement strategies â€“ best fit, first fit, next fit and worst fit.
